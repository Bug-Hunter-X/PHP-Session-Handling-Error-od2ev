This code exhibits a common error in PHP related to session handling.  The session isn't properly started before attempting to access or modify session variables.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

```php
<?php
// Attempting to access a session variable without starting the session
$username = $_SESSION['username'];

// ... some code ...

// Attempting to set a session variable without starting the session
$_SESSION['loggedIn'] = true;
?>
```
